# Project Presentation
2018
Observing that people were becoming more and more conscious about the indelible mark left by their activity on classic social medias, I imagined and developed a social network app allowing high school students to post anonymously about their community in a common feed, launch anonymous conversations and reveal their identities at the most appropriate (or funniest) moment. The anonymous nature of the app was challenging, I implemented anti-harassment features (no photos, 3 dislikes and the post/comment disappeared, permanent user blocking) in order for it to stay a safe place. Was available on the App Stores (https://iphone.apkpure.com/developer/antoine-salamitou)

Personal project - and old so a lot of refactoring if I had to make it alive again.
